It is still underperforming.\n\u2022 Despite exclusive focus on profitable-only merchants, increased effort in core agro categories, and improved efficiency of direct overheads, Agrofy's burn rate was 7% above forecast due to lower revenue from Pay and Transaction, in addition to severance package payouts.\n\u2022 Agrofy expects to be CFBE in 2024, using existing cash resources in Argentina while operating in Brazil and growing monetization from Pay and Transactions.\n\nCo-Investors\n\n[SP Ventures logo]     [Syngenta logo]     [Draper Cygnus logo]     [CND ENDEAVOR logo]\n\nCapria Ventures LLC\n\nConfidential                                                             12",

    "\\2023 Q4 Capria Fund II Report_page_2.png": "Letter to Investors\n\nDear Investors,\n\nWe are pleased to present you with the third quarterly report for Capria Fund II, LP (\u201cGlobal South II,\u201d or \u201cGS II\u201d). We continue to source and evaluate quality pipeline for Global South II as we work toward our final close, expected by the end of this year.\n\nBelow is a summary for the quarter that ended December 31, 2023:\n\n- In Q4, Global South II made one new investment, USD 960K in Wify. We also funded an additional USD 650K of the USD 1M commitment in GoFlux. This brings the number of company investments to 6.\n- We have actively engaged with our portfolio companies to help them identify, prototype, and deploy applications of GenAI. We believe this is critical for them to realize their potential and fend off competitors.\n- Capria\u2019s Managing Partners continue to garner attention from top media outlets, particularly around our thought leadership on applied GenAI.\n- Our next quarterly capital call (if we need to call capital next quarter) will be in April 2024, in the 0.50 - 2.00% range.\n\nPortfolio Additions and Updates\n\nWify, headquartered in India, has emerged as the #1 home furnishings installation player by seamlessly bridging the gap between modern home brands and skilled technicians. Note that Wify stands for \u201cWe Install For You\u201d; they need a new name, and we\u2019ve sourced a branding agency to help with that.\n\nWith the growing number of urban households and rising disposable incomes in India, the demand for modern home solutions has surged. While most players have a strong portfolio of modern products and efficient supply channels, they face challenges in providing at-home or on-field support to consumers.\n\nWify addresses this by upskilling traditional tradesmen and integrating technology, resulting in increased productivity, higher worker incomes, and improved customer satisfaction. What\u2019s more, Wify is one of the few companies in the fast-growing gig economy sector that has demonstrated strong evidence of income growth for gig workers. Currently, the average annual income of these workers is below USD 1,000, but Wify has shown that they can increase it by 2-3 times within 1-2 years of being on the platform.\n\nSince its inception in 2019, Wify has served over 180 home improvement brands and is the market leader in the furniture category. Major MNCs, including Unilever, Welspun, and Hettich, are also using Wify\u2019s SaaS technology for their operations. As of Q4 2023, Wify\u2019s ARR stands at ~INR 35Cr (~USD 4.2M), with the annual revenue growing at 50% in CY23. Wify completed more than 212K installations in CY23, a growth of 53% as compared to CY22.\n\nIn December 2023, Wify closed its Pre-Series A3 round, raising ~INR 17.9CR (~USD 2.2M), with Globa South II investing ~USD 960K. This was a cross-fund investment led by an outside investor. We invested in Wify previously as a warehoused investment for Capria India Fund III (yet to be formed).\n\nCapria Ventures LLC\nConfidential\n2",
    "\\2023 Q4 Capria Fund II Report_page_3.png": "Kueski, headquartered in Mexico City, is a fintech company providing fast and easy access to online credit for qualified individuals across Mexico\u2019s middle and lower-income segments. Access to credit remains one of the significant untapped opportunities in the region, with Mexico hosting the world's 5th largest unbanked population with 60M people. This presents immense potential for Kueski to grow and extend its offering.\n\nBoosted by its strong technology, Kueski ended 2023 with USD 171M in annual revenues, a 65% increase over 2022. In Q4 2023 alone, revenue grew 20% from the prior quarter. As of December, the company has more than 512K monthly active users, marking an increase of 12% QoQ and 16% YoY. Kueski also added various new offerings across 6 platforms: KueskiPay, KueskiCash, KueskiUP, Kueski Store, Kueski Debit, and Kueski Care.\n\nRecurrence drives more than 84% of Kueski\u2019s revenues, meaning customers value not only the service but also that a significant portion of their customer base completes the terms of their loans. Kueski is the most accepted BNPL provider in Mexico and a category leader in LatAm. Kueski is well positioned to add new users to the formal financial system, increasing its leadership in the middle-income digital consumer credit opportunity.\n\nWe have closed two additional investments as of the date of this letter, and we\u2019ll provide more details about them in the Q1\u201924 report.\n\n2023: Building Next-Gen Companies Enabled by GenAI\n\n2023 will go down in history as a year that changed EVERYTHING, thanks to GenAI. Or, at a minimum, it\u2019s the long-awaited beginning of the AI era. The long-standing quip information is power holds true. However, the game is different than before, where access to information was the differentiating factor. Now, information is everywhere and easily accessible. The differentiator is 1) how efficiently you can process it and 2) how quickly and accurately you can derive insights from it \u2013 in the form of a coherent response. While the tech giants battle it out on those two aspects, we are happy to strategically position ourselves to leverage the application of GenAI into economic output throughout the Global South.\n\nNever before in our lives have we seen a technology so powerful that it will dwarf in its wake the combined impact of the tech waves we have witnessed in the past few decades. GenAI will transform all aspects of our lives - business, politics, media, and culture. It is more than just a technology; it's a catalyst for exponential growth.\n\nAs we reflect on the remarkable journey of 2023, we wanted to share key highlights of the year.\n\n- In a significant milestone, Capria Ventures and Unitus Ventures joined forces to become the VC powerhouse specializing in the Global South. This strategic move towards operating as one brand (Capria Ventures) has allowed us to pool our expertise and resources, propelling our shared commitment to fostering innovation and growth in the entrepreneurial hotspots of India, Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia.\n- The USD 100-million Global South Fund II launch shows our commitment to the USD 9 trillion GDP growth opportunity we see over the next 5 years in the Global South. This fund catalyzes investment in high-potential ventures that harness the power of GenAI to drive growth for companies in sectors such as Jobtech, Fintech, Edtech, Climate, and SaaS.\n- We invested substantial time and resources to accelerate the adoption of GenAI technologies across our portfolio. This includes an internal 7-person GenAI team \n\nCapria Ventures LLC\nConfidential\n3",

We've developed a proprietary GenAI framework for assessing every company in our portfolio and pipeline on their GenAI strategy, and our team launched GAIN, Capria's GenAI Network for founders.\nWe also expanded our regional investment team presence, opening an office in Jakarta with 2 new team members to focus on the SE Asia market. In LatAm, we now have teams based in Mexico City (3), Buenos Aires (2), and Sao Paulo (1). Our Bangalore team has expanded to 10 members. We have 1, soon 2, Africa team members in Nairobi.\n\nOur portfolio companies have showcased exceptional agility and innovation throughout the year. Below is a quick summary of how our portfolio is adopting GenAI:\n\u2022 Agrofy: Natural language searching via a Whatsapp GenAI chatbot increases accuracy and facilitates marketplace transactions\n\u2022 Goflux: ML to improve underwriting; GenAI to provide accessibility and insights into complex reports and analysis\n\u2022 Kueski: ML for credit scoring; GenAI to help first-time borrowers better understand financial products\n\u2022 MAX: Natural language interface for interacting with complex internal databases\n\u2022 Paymxb: Introduced 'Shield', an advanced online protection tool that uses AI for real-time issue detection and resolution. GenAI code generation to cut dev costs and increase the speed of merchant onboarding and integration\n\u2022 Wify: Evaluating GenAI to deliver in-the-field, just-in-time training to decrease the time for staff to reach profitability\n\nAs we celebrate the successes of 2023, we are confident that further application of applied Generative AI in the coming year will open new frontiers in innovation and reshape the landscape of the Global South.\n\n2024: Prototypes Move to Production; GenAI-first\n\nWhile 2023 was the year of experimenting with and prototyping with the new GenAI technologies, 2024 will be the year that those technologies move into serious production and start realizing the benefits, including lower operating costs, improvements to existing products/services, and even new products/services only possible with GenAI.\n\nWe will also see a new crop startup in sectors such as fintech, jobtech, edtech, healthtech, agtech, climate, and more which are \u201cGenAI-first\u201d \u2013 that is, they will be building from the beginning with GenAI to leapfrog existing solutions. Most investments will be pre-seed and seed stage, with a few of them advancing to receive Pre-Series A and Series A investments.\n\nCapria in the News\n\nIn September 2023, Unitus Ventures and Capria Ventures unified to create a Global South VC powerhouse and operate with a unified global strategy under a single brand, Capria Ventures.

Gradually, he expanded his services to cater to a growing list of clients.\n\nThe teaching support, live classes, and interactive platform at the Aprende Institute provided the tools and resources he needed to excel.

Relying on ad hoc advice on social media and local agri input stores for help, he was confused.\n\nThen one day, he came across a video about BharatAgri, a crop input e-commerce platform, designed to help farmers increase their farm incomes.\n\nDatta installed the app and subscribed to BharatAgri's Crop Calendar. Through the app, he received personalized advice based on the local weather, regional soil conditions, satellite imaging of the farm, and recommended sowing dates.\n\nIn just one season, Datta was able to reduce his expenses on agrochemicals and fertilizers by 30% and increase his harvest from 60 quintal/acre to 110 quintal/acre.

The general partner of the Partnership is Capria II GP LLC, a Washington limited liability company (the \"General Partner\").\n\nThis Statement is being furnished to prospective investors (\"Investors\" or \"Limited Partners\") on a confidential basis so that they may consider an investment in the Partnership. By accepting this Statement, the recipient acknowledges and agrees that it (a) will maintain the information contained herein in the strictest of confidence and will not, in any circumstance whatsoever; reproduce this Statement or disclose any of the contents hereof to any other person and (b) will return this Statement to the Partnership if so requested by the Partnership or a representative of the Partnership or if the recipient does not wish to pursue an investment in the securities offered hereby and will return to the Partnership any other material that the recipient may have received from the Partnership in the course of reviewing such investment.\n\nThe Interests are being offered only to Investors who meet certain qualifications. The Partnership reserves the right to approve each Investor.\n\nAn investment in the Partnership involves a high degree of risk, and is suitable only for investors of substantial means who have no immediate need for liquidity of the amount invested and who can afford a risk of loss of all or a substantial part of such investment. There can be no assurance that the Partnership's investment objectives will be achieved, or that a Limited Partner will receive a return of its Capital Contributions. Each Investor should consult with his, her or its personal legal, tax and financial advisers and carefully consider and evaluate the risks before making an investment in the Partnership. Investors may be subject to a number of risks, only some of which are set forth below. Any terms used below but not defined below shall have the definition set forth in the Partnership's Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement (including all appendices and exhibits, as amended from time to time (the \"Partnership Agreement\")).\n\nGeneral Risks\n\nReliance on Management. The Limited Partners will not have a right or power to participate in the management of the Partnership. Accordingly, no investor should purchase an Interest unless it is willing to entrust all aspects of management of the Partnership to the Management Company, subject to the oversight of the General Partner. The Limited Partners will not receive detailed financial information issued by Portfolio Investments in which the Partnership invests, which may be available to the Partnership.\n\nCompetition for Investments. The Partnership will compete with other entities in making investments in Portfolio Investments. Such competition may come from groups such as institutional investors and investment managers that have greater resources than the Partnership and are owned by large and well-capitalized investors. There may be intense competition for\n\n45\n313054183.1",
    "\\Capria Fund II, LP - Subscription Agreement_page_46.png": "investments of the type in which the Partnership intends to invest, and such competition may result in less favorable investment terms than would otherwise be the case. The Partnership may be unable to find a sufficient number of attractive opportunities to meet its investment objective. There can, therefore, be no assurance that investments of the Partnership will meet all the investment objective of the Partnership, or that the Partnership will be able to invest all of its available capital.\n\nUnspecified Investments. The Commitments received from the Limited Partners pursuant to this offering are going into a blind pool. The Partnership has not identified the particular investments it will make. Accordingly, a Limited Partner must rely upon the ability of the General Partner and the Management Company (including any investment committee) in making investments consistent with the Partnership\u2019s investment objectives and policies. An investor will not have the opportunity to individually evaluate the relevant economic, financial and other information that will be utilized by the General Partner in its selection of investments or otherwise approve of such investments.\n\nNo Assurance of Investment Return. The Partnership\u2019s task of identifying opportunities in private operating companies and venture capital funds, managing such investments and realizing a significant return for investors is difficult. Many organizations operated by persons of competence and integrity have been unable to make, manage, and realize such investments successfully. There is no assurance that the Partnership will be able to invest its capital on attractive terms or generate returns for its investors. There is no assurance that the Partnership\u2019s investments will be profitable and there is a risk that the Partnership\u2019s losses and expenses will exceed its income and gains. As such, there is no assurance of any distribution to the Limited Partners prior to, or upon, liquidation of the Partnership.\n\nLong-Term and Illiquid Investment within the Partnership. An investment in the Partnership is a long-term commitment. The Interests are highly illiquid and have no public market value. No secondary market for the Interests exists, and no such market will be established or approved by the General Partner. Furthermore, the sale or transfer of Interests is subject to approval of the General Partner and other restrictions contained in the Partnership Agreement. Consequently, Limited Partners may not be able to liquidate an investment in the event of an emergency or for any other reason. An investment in the Partnership is suitable only for persons and entities which have no need for liquidity with respect to their investment. The Interests have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201c1933 Act\u201d), nor is any such registration contemplated.\n\nDiverse Group of Limited Partners. The Limited Partners may have conflicting investment, tax, and other interests with respect to their investments in the Partnership. The conflicting interests of individual Limited Partners may relate to or arise from, among other items, the nature of investments made by the Partnership, the structuring or the acquisition of investments, and the timing of disposition of investments. As a consequence, conflicts of interest may arise in connection with decisions made by the General Partner, including with respect to the nature or structuring of investments that may be more beneficial for one investor than for another investor, particularly with respect to investors\u2019 individual tax situations. In selecting and structuring investments appropriate for the Partnership, the General Partner will consider the investment and\n\n46\n313054183.1",
    "\\Capria Fund II, LP - Subscription Agreement_page_47.png": "tax objectives of the Partnership and the Partners as a whole, not the investment, tax, or other objectives of any Limited Partner individually.\n\nDefault. If a Limited Partner defaults on its obligation to make required Capital Contributions to the Partnership, it may be difficult for the Partnership to make up the shortfall from other sources. Any such default by one or more Limited Partners could have a material adverse effect on the Partnership, its investments, and the other Limited Partners, including without limitation by subjecting the Partnership to significant penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the Partnership and the Limited Partners, including the non-defaulting Limited Partners. A default by a Limited Partner may also limit the Partnership\u2019s availability to incur borrowings and avail itself of what would otherwise have been available credit.\n\nConflicts. The Partnership will be subject to certain conflicts of interest arising out of its relationship with the General Partner, the Management Company (including any investment committee) and their members, and the affiliates thereof. The agreements and arrangements among the Partnership, the General Partner, and the Management Company have been established by the General Partner and are not the result of arm\u2019s-length negotiations.\n\nAcknowledgment of Conflicts. The conflicts of interest described in this Statement are explicitly acknowledged and consented to by each Limited Partner by submitting a Subscription Agreement. By acquiring an Interest, each Limited Partner will be deemed to have waived any claim with respect to any liability arising from the existence of the foregoing. Other present and future activities of the Management Company, the General Partner and their affiliates may give rise to additional conflicts of interest. In the event that a conflict of interest arises, the Management Company, the General Partner and their affiliates will attempt to resolve such conflicts in a fair and equitable manner.\n\nWithdrawals. Voluntary withdrawals of Limited Partner interests are not permitted, except in limited instances when required or when necessary to comply with the laws or regulations applicable to a Limited Partner or otherwise stated in the Partnership Agreement. As a result, Limited Partners may not be able to liquidate their investments prior to the end of the Partnership\u2019s term. A withdrawn Limited Partner may not be entitled to immediate payment for its Interest in the Partnership. Any withdrawal of a Limited Partner may reduce the amount of Partnership capital available for investment or other activities.\n\nEconomic Interest of the General Partner. Because the percentage of profits allocated to the General Partner may exceed the Capital Contribution percentage of the General Partner, and because certain net losses otherwise allocable to the General Partner will be specially allocated to all the Partners, the General Partner may have an incentive to make investments that are riskier or more speculative than if the General Partner received allocations on a basis identical to that of the Limited Partners.\n\nNo Operating History. The Partnership has no operating history upon which prospective investors can evaluate its likely performance. There can be no assurance that the Partnership will achieve its investment objective.\n\n47\n313054183.1",
    "\\Capria Fund II, LP - Subscription Agreement_page_48.png": "Dependence on the Managing Principals. The Partnership will be dependent on the efforts and ability of the Managing Principals, and any future Managing Principal. The Limited Partners will be relying on the management expertise of the Managing Principals in identifying, acquiring, administering and disposing of the Partnership\u2019s investments. Past investment performance by the Managing Principals provides no assurance of future results. Further, a loss of any individual at the General Partner or Management Company could have a material, adverse effect on the Partnership. Unless otherwise agreed in the Partnership Agreement, additional members may be admitted to the General Partner or Management Company (including any investment committee or as a Managing Principal) following the Initial Closing, and the Limited Partners will have no power to prevent any specific person from being admitted to the General Partner as a member thereof nor will the Limited Partners have the right to consent to the admission of additional members of the General Partner. If, for any reason, the Managing Principals or any other member of the General Partner or Management Company should cease to be involved in the investment management of the Partnership, suitable replacements may be difficult to obtain, with the result that the performance of the Partnership may be adversely affected. Further, the Partnership\u2019s success depends, to a significant extent, upon the efforts and abilities of the Managing Principals. The Partnership\u2019s failure to retain the services of the Managing Principals could adversely affect the Partnership\u2019s operating and financial performance.\n\nAllocation of Investment Opportunities. The General Partner, in its discretion, may offer co-investment opportunities to third parties, the Limited Partners, the members of, or others associated with, the General Partner, or vehicles sponsored by the General Partner or its Affiliates (collectively, \u201cCapria\u201d) in circumstances where excess opportunity exists after the Partnership has invested an appropriate amount.\n\nCapria intends to manage potential conflicts of interest among the Partnership, any Co-Investment Vehicle and any related funds or vehicles in an equitable manner and through consultation with the applicable advisory committee. In particular, Capria will resolve conflicts relating to the allocation of the investment opportunities among the Partnership, any Co-Investment Vehicle and any related funds or vehicles in accordance with the investment allocation policy of the Management Company and may take into consideration relevant factors such as whether the investment is a follow-on investment, applicable investment restrictions, portfolio composition and similar factors. Limited Partners should be aware that conflicts will not necessarily be resolved in favor of the Partnership\u2019s interests. The Partnership Agreement may require consent of the Advisory Committee to enter into certain transactions and the failure of the Advisory Committee to grant such consent would prevent the Partnership from consummating certain investments and therefore, could adversely affect the Partnership.\n\nOther funds or accounts managed by Capria may invest in subsequent rounds of securities of the same Portfolio Company (or subsequent offerings of other Portfolio Investments) and it is intended that any Co-Investment Vehicle will make such investments. Such investments inherently involve conflicts of interest between the Partnership and the other existing fund or account. For example, funds or accounts that did or did not participate in an earlier round of financing will have differing interests with respect to the valuation of a Portfolio Company and the price of a later round of financing, and may have differing interests with respect to the exit price of an investment. In addition, funds or accounts that have differing investment horizons\n\n48\n313054183.1",

The Management Company, the General Partner and their affiliates are not restricted from forming additional investment vehicles, from entering into other investment advisory relationships or from engaging in other business activities, even though such activities may be in competition with the Partnership and/or may involve substantial time and resources of such persons. Such investment accounts or vehicles may have investment objectives and policies that are similar to those of the Partnership. There is no limitation with respect to the Management Company and its affiliates on other activities and investments or with respect to the activities of other investment portfolios managed or advised by the Management Company or its affiliates. Accordingly, conflicts of interest may occur.\n\nOther Activities. Except as may be specifically provided in the Partnership Agreement, the members of the General Partner and Management Company may devote their time and efforts to businesses and projects other than the Partnership. Such business and projects other than the Partnership may include, among other things, sponsoring and operating special purpose acquisition companies or an opportunity fund.\n\nCybersecurity and Technology Risk. The General Partner, its service providers, and other market participants increasingly depend on complex information technology and communications systems, which are subject to a number of different threats and risks that could adversely affect the Partnership or a Limited Partner. These risks include, among others, theft, misuse, and improper release of confidential or highly sensitive information relating to a client or its account, as well as compromises or failures of systems, networks, devices and applications relating to the operations of the General Partner and its service providers. Power outages, natural disasters, equipment malfunctions and processing errors that threaten these systems, as well as market events that occur at a pace that overloads these systems, may also disrupt business operations or impact critical data. Cybersecurity and other operational and technology issues may result in financial losses to a Limited Partner, impede business transactions, violate privacy and other laws, subject a Limited Partner to certain regulatory penalties and reputational damage, and increase compliance costs and expenses. Although the General Partner has developed processes and risk management systems designed to reduce these risks, the General Partner does not directly control the cybersecurity defenses, operational and technology plans and systems of service providers, financial intermediaries and companies in which the Partnership has assets or with which the Partnership does business.\n\nPortfolio Investment Risks\n\nRisk Inherent in Venture Capital Investments. The types of investments that the Partnership anticipates making involve a high degree of risk. In general, financial and operating risks confronting Portfolio Investments can be significant. The loss of all of a Limited Partner\u2019s Capital Contributions is possible. The timing of profit realization is highly uncertain. Losses are likely to occur early in the Partnership\u2019s life, while successes often require a long period of time for an investment to mature.",

    "\\Capria Fund II, LP - Subscription Agreement_page_50.png": "Early-Stage Investments. The Partnership intends to invest in privately held, early-stage companies. These companies typically have no revenues and are not profitable. They require considerable additional capital to develop technologies and markets, acquire customers and achieve or maintain a competitive position. This capital may not be available at all, or on acceptable terms. Further, the technologies and markets of such companies may not develop as anticipated, even after substantial expenditures of capital. Such companies may face intense competition, including competition from established companies with much greater financial resources, more extensive development, manufacturing, marketing and service capabilities, and a greater number of qualified managerial and technical personnel. Typically, although the Partnership may be represented by a member of the Management Company on a Portfolio Company\u2019s board of directors, each Portfolio Company will be managed by its own officers (who generally will not be affiliated with the Partnership or the Management Company). Portfolio Investments may have substantial variations in operating results from period to period and experience failures or substantial declines in value at any stage.\n\nLack of Diversification. The Partnership\u2019s objective is to invest in early-stage companies that have the potential to positively impact climate stabilization. In furtherance of that objective, the Partnership may invest in a limited number of companies, sectors, countries, or regions, and may not enjoy the reduced risks of a fund, portfolio, or portfolio of funds that is broadly diversified across multiple asset classes and investment strategies. To the extent the Partnership concentrates its investments in a particular company, sector, country, or region, its investments will become more susceptible to fluctuations in value resulting from adverse business or economic conditions affecting that particular company, sector, or region. As a consequence, the aggregate return of the Partnership may be adversely affected by the unfavorable performance of one or a small number of companies, sectors, countries or regions in which the Partnership has invested. In certain cases, the Partnership may acquire a majority of, or all of, the interests in a Portfolio Company, which could further increase the vulnerability of the Partnership\u2019s portfolio.\n\nMultiple Levels of Expenses. The Partnership expects to invest a portion of its assets in interests of portfolio funds purchased in secondary market transactions. This multi-manager approach also exposes Limited Partners to multiple levels of fees, carried interests and expenses. In addition to the Management Fee and the carried interest distributed to the General Partner, each underlying portfolio fund may charge a management fee, distribute a carried interest to such fund\u2019s general partner or manager, and may incur expenses. Limited Partners will indirectly bear the Partnership\u2019s share of the fees and expenses charged by the portfolio funds in which the Partnership invests, in addition to the Partnership\u2019s direct fees and expenses (including without limitation the Management Fee and the carried interest distributed to the General Partner). These fees and expenses reduce the returns generated by the Partnership and may, in the aggregate, be higher than fees charged by investment funds with a single manager.\n\nVenture Capital Investments. The Partnership may invest in a portfolio fund that is focused on early-stage venture capital investments or make investments in such portfolio companies directly. Typically, such companies have no or limited operating history, unproven technology, untested management, and unknown future capital needs. These types of companies also face increased competition from established companies. The Partnership\u2019s direct or indirect investments in such companies will be highly speculative and may result in the loss of the Partnership\u2019s capital in respect of such portfolio investments.\n\n50\n313054183.1",
    "\\Capria Fund II, LP - Subscription Agreement_page_51.png": "Lack of Uniform Reporting Standards for Underlying Funds; Asset Valuation. Because there will generally be no established market for the Partnership\u2019s investments and because the underlying funds and portfolio companies utilize divergent reporting standards, the Partnership\u2019s Portfolio Investments will be difficult to value and monitor. Underlying fund investments will also be difficult to value because it may be relatively difficult for the Partnership to obtain reliable valuations of the underlying investments of such funds. In most cases the Partnership will rely on the valuations provided to it by Portfolio Investments, as applicable. Prospective investors should be aware that situations involving uncertainties as to valuation of assets held by the Partnership could have an adverse effect on the returns of the Partnership.\n\nRisks of Investing in Emerging Markets. The Partnership may make significant investments in countries that are considered \u201cemerging markets\u201d. Investors should consider a number of risks associated with investments in emerging-market countries. Described below are certain significant risks specific to these investments.\n\nPolitical/Sovereign Risk. The economies of individual emerging-market countries may differ favorably or unfavorably from those of developed countries in such respects as growth of gross domestic product, rate of inflation, currency depreciation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency, and balance of payments position, and currency-hedging techniques may be unavailable in certain emerging market countries. Emerging-market countries may be more likely to experience rapid and significant adverse developments in their political or economic structures, which may have negative impacts on transaction costs, market price, investment return and the legal rights and remedies of the Partnership. Governments of many emerging-market countries have exercised and continue to exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector. In some cases, the government owns or controls many companies, including some of the largest in the country. Accordingly, government actions could have a significant effect on economic and market conditions in an emerging-market country. Moreover, the economies of emerging-market countries generally are heavily dependent upon international trade and, accordingly, have been and may continue to be adversely affected by trade barriers, exchange controls, managed adjustments in relative currency values, and other protectionist measures imposed or negotiated by the countries with which they trade. These economies also have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic conditions in the countries with which they trade and by the spreading of difficulties in other emerging-market economies. With respect to any emerging-market country, there is the possibility of nationalization, expropriation, or confiscatory taxation, political changes, government regulation, economic or social instability, or political developments (including war) which could affect adversely the economies of such countries or the value of the Partnership\u2019s investments in those countries.\n\nInvestment and Repatriation Restrictions. Some emerging-market countries have laws and regulations that currently limit or preclude direct foreign investment in the securities of their companies or their real estate. Prior government approval for foreign investments may be required under certain circumstances in some emerging-market countries, and the process of obtaining these approvals may require a significant expenditure of time and resources. Repatriation of investment income, capital, and the proceeds of sale by foreign\n\n51\n313054183.1",
    "\\Capria Fund II, LP - Subscription Agreement_page_52.png": "investors may require governmental registration and approval in some emerging-market countries.\n\nFurthermore, investments in companies operating in emerging-market countries may require significant government approvals under corporate, securities, exchange control, foreign investment, and other similar laws and may require financing and structuring alternatives that differ significantly from those customarily used in more developed countries. In addition, in certain countries such laws and regulations have been subject to frequent and unforeseen change potentially exposing the Partnership to restrictions, taxes, and other obligations that were not anticipated at the time the initial investment was made.\n\nLegal Framework and Corporate Governance. Many emerging markets do not have developed legal frameworks, and it may be difficult to obtain and enforce a judgment in the courts of such countries. In particular, many emerging markets do not have well-developed shareholders\u2019 rights, which could adversely affect the Partnership\u2019s minority investments. In addition, many emerging markets provide inadequate legal remedies for breaches of contract (e.g., a shareholder agreement) and existing law may be subject to manipulation. Prior government approval may be required in order to obtain certain legal remedies in these countries, and the process of obtaining these approvals may require a significant expenditure of time and resources.\n\nLack of Transparency. Companies in emerging-market countries are not generally subject to uniform accounting, auditing, and financial reporting standards, practices, and disclosure requirements comparable to those applicable to U.S. companies. In particular, the assets and profits appearing on the financial statements of a company operating in emerging markets may not reflect its financial position or results of operations in the way they would be reflected had such financial statements been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, for companies that keep accounting records in local currency, inflation accounting rules in some emerging-market countries require, for both tax and accounting purposes, that certain assets and liabilities be restated on the company\u2019s balance sheet in order to express items in terms of constant purchasing power. As a result, financial data may be materially affected by restatements for inflation and may not accurately reflect the real condition of companies and securities markets. Accordingly, the Management Company\u2019s ability to conduct due diligence in connection with its investment and to monitor the investment may be adversely affected by these and other factors.\n\nAvailability of Investment Capital. Early-stage investments often require several rounds of capital infusions before the Portfolio Company reaches maturity. If a Limited Partner does not have funds available to participate in subsequent rounds of financing, that shortfall may have a significant negative impact on both the Portfolio Company and the face value of the Limited Partner\u2019s Capital Contribution. Although it will be the Partnership\u2019s policy to maintain sufficient liquidity to allow it to participate in follow-on rounds of financings, the Partnership does not intend to provide all necessary follow-on financing. Accordingly, third-party sources of financing will be required. There is no assurance that such additional sources of financing will be available, or, if available, will be on terms beneficial to the Partnership. Furthermore, the\n\n52\n313054183.1",
    "\\Capria Fund II, LP - Subscription Agreement_page_53.png": "Partnership\u2019s capital is limited and may not be adequate to protect the Partnership from dilution in multiple rounds of Portfolio Company financing.\n\nLack of Liquidity of the Investment Portfolio. The Partnership\u2019s investment portfolio will consist of investments in early-stage private companies. The marketability and value of each such investment will depend upon many factors beyond the General Partner\u2019s control. Generally, the investments made by the Partnership will be illiquid and difficult to value, and there will be little or no collateral to protect an investment once made. At the time of the Partnership\u2019s investment, a Portfolio Company may lack one or more key attributes (e.g., proven technology, marketable product, complete management team, or strategic alliances) necessary for success. There may be no readily available market for the Partnership\u2019s investments, many of which will be difficult to value, and the disposal of an investment in a Portfolio Company by the Partnership may be prohibited or delayed many years from the date of initial investment for legal and/or regulatory reasons. The public market for emerging growth companies is extremely volatile. Such volatility may adversely affect the development of Portfolio Companies, the ability of the Partnership to dispose of investments, and the value of investment securities on the date of sale or distribution by the Partnership.\n\nRisks of Certain Dispositions. In connection with the disposition of an investment in a Portfolio Investment or otherwise, the Partnership may be required to make representations about the business and financial affairs of the Portfolio Investment typical of those made in connection with the sale of any business. It may also be required to indemnify the purchasers of such investment to the extent that any such representations are inaccurate, and under certain circumstances described in the Partnership Agreement, the General Partner may make distributions of cash or securities to the Partners that remain subject to recall for the payment (in whole or in part) of such contingent liabilities. These arrangements may result in contingent liabilities, which ultimately have to be funded by the Partnership.\n\nReliance on Underlying Managers; Non-Controlling Interests. The Partnership is not expected to have the right to participate in the day-to-day management, control, or operations of the Portfolio Investments, nor will it often have the right to unilaterally remove the managers of underlying portfolio funds or management or directors of underlying portfolio companies. Although the General Partner will monitor the performance of each Portfolio Investment, it will primarily be the responsibility of each Portfolio Investment\u2019s management team to operate the portfolio fund or the portfolio company, as applicable.\n\nAccess to Information from Underlying Managers. The General Partner may request information from underlying fund and portfolio company management regarding the historical performance and strategy of such management. The General Partner may also request detailed portfolio information on a continuing basis from each Portfolio Investment. However, the General Partner may not always be provided with such information because certain of this information may be considered proprietary information by the particular Portfolio Investment. This lack of access to information may make it more difficult for the General Partner to select, allocate among, and evaluate Portfolio Investments and potential portfolio investments.\n\nCOVID-19. As of the date of this document, there is an outbreak of a novel and highly contagious form of coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d), which the World Health Organization has\n\n53\n313054183.1",
    "\\Capria Fund II, LP - Subscription Agreement_page_54.png": "declared to constitute a pandemic. The outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in a great number of deaths, adversely impacted global commercial activity, and contributed to significant volatility in certain economic markets. The global impact of the outbreak continues to evolve, and many countries have reacted by instituting (and, in some cases, reinstituting) quarantines, prohibitions on travel and the closure of offices, businesses, schools, retail stores and other public venues. Businesses have also implemented similar precautionary measures. Such measures, as well as the general uncertainty surrounding the dangers and impact of COVID-19, are creating significant disruption in supply chains and economic activity have had and continue to have a particularly adverse impact on certain specific industries. The impact of COVID-19 has led to significant volatility in the global public equity markets, and it is uncertain how long this volatility will continue. As COVID-19 continues to spread, the potential impacts, including a global, regional, or other economic recession, are increasingly uncertain and difficult to assess.\n\nAny public health emergency, including COVID-19 or other existing or new epidemic diseases, or the threat thereof, and the resulting financial and economic market uncertainty could have a significant adverse impact on the Partnership, its underlying fund investments, and their portfolio companies, and could adversely affect the Partnership\u2019s and its underlying fund investments\u2019 ability to fulfill their respective investment objectives. The extent of the impact of any public health emergency on the Partnership\u2019s or its underlying fund investments\u2019 operational and financial performance will depend on many factors, including the duration and scope of such public health emergency, the extent of any related travel advisories and restrictions implemented, the impact of such public health emergency on overall supply and demand, goods and services, investor liquidity, consumer confidence and levels of economic activity, and the extent of disruption to important global, regional and local supply chains and economic markets, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\n\nIn addition, as part of the response to COVID-19 and related economic disruptions, global central banks have, in addition to other governmental actions to stabilize markets and seek to encourage economic growth, acted to hold interest rates to low rates. It cannot be predicted with certainty when, or how, these policies will change, but actions by the central banks may have a significant effect on interest rates and on world economies generally, which in turn may affect the performance of the Partnership\u2019s investments. Further financial or economic crises may result in additional governmental intervention in the markets.\n\nLegal, Tax and Regulatory Risks\n\nLegal, Tax and Regulatory Risks. Legal, tax, and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the Partnership that may adversely affect the Partnership, the Portfolio Investments, or the Limited Partners. For example, changes in laws and regulations applicable to taxation of carried interest may result in certain types of investments and/or investment returns being treated differently and accordingly may influence the General Partner\u2019s decisions as to how to best structure the investment profiles of the Partnership. The Partnership may have limited legal recourse in the event of a dispute, and remedies might have to be pursued in the courts of a variety of countries.\n\nRegulatory Considerations. While the Partnership may be considered similar in some ways to an investment company, it is not required, and does not intend, to register as such under the",
    "\\Capria Fund II, LP - Subscription Agreement_page_55.png": "Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d) and, accordingly, the Limited Partners are not accorded the protections of the 1940 Act. While the General Partner and Management Company are not registered as investment advisers under the Advisers Act or any state law, the Management Company expects to register with the SEC in 2023. Accordingly, until the time of such registration, the Partnership and the Limited Partners will not be subject to the protections of the Advisers Act insofar as it relates to registered investment advisers. In the meantime, the General Partner and Management Company intend to rely on exemptions from registration under the Advisers Act. In order to ensure that the General Partner and its Affiliates may continue to rely upon an exemption from registration under the Advisers Act, the General Partner intends, so far as may be necessary or desirable, to operate the Partnership in a manner that allows it to be a \u201cventure capital fund,\u201d which may limit the ability of the Partnership to make certain types of investments, which in turn could negatively impact the Partnership\u2019s performance. The General Partner cannot assure investors that, under certain conditions, changing circumstances or changes in law, the General Partner, the Management Company or any of their affiliates may not be required to register (or register earlier than anticipated) under the Advisers Act or under similar state law.\n\nExculpation and Indemnification. The assets of the Partnership generally may be available to satisfy the liabilities and other obligations of the Partnership, including, without limitation, the indemnification rights of the General Partner, the Management Company and certain other persons specified in the Partnership Agreement. If the Partnership becomes subject to a liability, the parties seeking to have the liability satisfied may have recourse to the Partnership\u2019s assets generally and not be limited to any particular Portfolio Investments, such as to limit the Investment giving rise to the liability. In addition, the Partnership Agreement will allow the General Partner to take primary responsibility for actions taken in the name and on behalf of the Partnership, except to the extent that liability is attributed to the actual knowledge, gross negligence, or willful misconduct by the General Partner or the Management Company or any of their respective individual representatives. In addition, the Partnership Agreement will limit the circumstances under which the General Partner, the Management Company and other parties may be held liable to the Partnership and the Partners. If the Partnership\u2019s assets are insufficient, the Partnership may recall distributions to meet indemnification objections (and other liabilities), subject to certain limitations set out in the Partnership Agreement.\n\nNo Counsel. K&L Gates LLP currently serves as U.S. legal counsel to the General Partner and the Management Company in connection with the matters described herein. K&L Gates LLP does not represent any current or prospective investors with respect to an investment in the Partnership. No separate counsel has been engaged by the General Partner or any of its affiliates to represent any current or prospective investors with respect to an investment in the Partnership.\n\nAudit Risks. It is possible that an audit of the Partnership\u2019s tax return by the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cService\u201d), if conducted, may result in an audit of a Limited Partner\u2019s tax return, if any. A Limited Partner that files a U.S. tax return must report each partnership item for U.S. federal income tax purposes consistent with its treatments on the partnership\u2019s return, unless such Limited Partner files a statement with his return which identifies the inconsistency. In the event of an audit, the tax treatment of all partnership items may be determined at the partnership level in a single proceeding rather than in separate proceedings with each Limited Partner. The General Partner may take primary responsibility for contesting federal income tax adjustments proposed by the Service, to extend the statute of limitations as to all Limited Partners and, in certain circumstances, the General Partner may be able to bind the Limited Partners to a settlement with the Service. The General Partner will inform each Limited Partner of a commencement and disposition of any such administrative proceeding. Nevertheless, a Limited",

The Partnership may not be able to provide final annual tax information to the Limited Partners for any given fiscal year until after April 15^th of the following year. The General Partner will use its reasonable efforts to provide the Limited Partners with annual tax information on or before such date, but final annual tax information will not be available until the Partnership has received tax-reporting information from the Portfolio Investments necessary to prepare final annual tax information. The Limited Partners should plan to obtain extensions of the filing dates for their U.S. federal, state and local income tax returns. Each prospective Limited Partner should consult with its own adviser as to the advisability and tax consequences of an investment in the Partnership.\n\nFATCA. The Partnership may take such action as it considers necessary in relation to a Limited Partner\u2019s holding or distributions, as a result of relevant legislation and regulations, including, but not limited to FATCA requirements in the United States and any other relevant jurisdiction. Such action may include disclosure by the Partnership, the General Partner or a service provider or delegate of the Partnership, of certain information relating to a Limited Partner to the Service.\n\nPartnership Agreement. In addition to the foregoing, the Partnership Agreement contains other provisions of which prospective Limited Partners should be aware.

However, due to the international nature of our business, there will be days when Team Members are expected to attend calls or meetings outside of these hours to accommodate colleagues or other stakeholders in different time zones. We encourage open communication and proactive planning with Team Members\u2019 managers to ensure a healthy sustainable work-life balance for all Team Members.\n\nWorking Early or Late\nFrom time to time, business needs may require Team Members to work extended hours, in the early morning, the evening, or on weekends.\n\nCapria will reimburse reasonable meals for Team Members working past 8:00 PM in the office on a weekday or for more than five hours in the office on the weekends. If it is so late that the Team Member\u2019s standard method of transportation home might be unsafe, Capria will also reimburse the cost of an Uber or equivalent form of transport, typically after 8:00 PM at night. Expenses should be submitted through the normal expense reimbursement process.\n\nDress Code\nIn general, Capria maintains a casual but professional environment.

All Team Members are encouraged to utilize their annual PTO.\n\nEach Team Member is granted 12.5 days of PTO in each calendar year, which accrues on a monthly basis. An additional 5 days of PTO is granted annually to those who have been with Capria for at least three years.\n\nTeam Members should obtain approval from their managers as far in advance as possible for their PTO. With their manager\u2019s written approval, Team Members may borrow up to 5 PTO days prior to accruing those PTO days. However, Team Members do this with the explicit understanding that if they leave Capria prior to accruing the borrowed days, compensation for those days will be deducted from their final paycheck.\n\nIf a Team Member has taken PTO, sick leave, or a floating holiday and is subsequently required to work at least one-half of the day, the Team Member may request leave credit for the time worked.

A lack of such notice and confirmation will cause the carry-over days to be forfeited. In the event the Team Member leaves Capria with an outstanding PTO balance, they will only be paid for the days earned in the current year plus up to 5 carryover days (if applicable), less the days they took in the current year.\n\nThis policy will be adjusted for individual cases to address any jurisdiction-specific requirements for PTO benefits.\n\nCapria Confidential\n10",

Capria will reimburse the Team Member up to USD $1,250 (or INR 1L in India or IDR 19M in Indonesia) for the purchase of a new laptop every 3 years. Once a reimbursement has been provided, another reimbursement benefit will only be provided again after 3 years. If a Team Member leaves before the 3 year mark, the amount reimbursed will be deducted from their payroll/payment on a prorated basis. For example, if the Team Member leaves after 1.5 years of utilizing the benefit then 50% of the benefit must be repaid.\n\nIndia team should consult the finance team about the billing process before procuring your laptop.\n\nCapria Confidential\n12",

Please evacuate immediately using the staircase. There are fire extinguishers placed on each floor in case of emergency. Please familiarize yourself with the location of the fire extinguisher on each floor. The typical steps for operating the fire extinguisher are:\n\n- Pull the safety pin\n- Aim the nozzle at the base of the fire, from a safe distance (about 1 to 3 meters away)\n- Squeeze the handle\n- Sweep the extinguisher from side to side while aiming at the base of the fire\n\nEmergency - Earthquake\n\nLocations where some of our team is based, like Seattle and California, are at a higher risk of an earthquake. The CDC recommends the following, explained simply in this 3-minute video:\n\n- DROP down onto your hands and knees before the earthquake knocks you down. This position protects you from falling but allows you to still move if necessary.\n- COVER your head and neck (and your entire body if possible) under the shelter of a sturdy table or desk. If there is no shelter nearby, get down near an interior wall or next to low-lying furniture that won't fall on you, and cover your head and neck with your arms and hands.\n- HOLD ON to your shelter (or to your head and neck) until the shaking stops. Be prepared to move with your shelter if the shaking shifts it around.\n\nDO NOT stand in a doorway. You are safer under a table. In modern houses, doorways are no stronger than any other part of the house. The doorway does not protect you from the most likely source of injury\u2014falling or flying objects. Most earthquake-related injuries and deaths are caused by falling or flying objects (e.g., TVs, lamps, glass, bookcases), or by being knocked to the ground.\n\nYou can take other actions, even while an earthquake is happening, that will reduce your chances of being hurt.\n\nCapria Confidential\n16",

    "\\CV Employee & Consultant Handbook - August 2023_page_23.png": "Harassment Prevention\n\nHarassment of a Team Member of any sort (actions, words, jokes, or comments based on an individual\u2019s race, color, caste, marital status, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, ancestry, age, or disability) will not be tolerated.\n\nWhat is Harassment?\nWorkplace harassment can take many forms. It may be, but is not limited to, words, signs, offensive jokes, cartoons, pictures, posters, email jokes or statements, pranks, intimidation, physical assaults or contact, or violence. Harassment is not necessarily sexual in nature (though sexual harassment is a critical issue and is detailed below). It may also take the form of other vocal activity including derogatory statements not directed to the targeted individual but taking place within their hearing. Other prohibited conduct includes written material such as notes, photographs, cartoons, articles of a harassing or offensive nature, and taking retaliatory action against a Team Member for discussing or making a harassment complaint.\n\nSexual Harassment\nSexual harassment may include unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or another verbal or physical contact of a sexual nature when such conduct creates an offensive, hostile, intimidating, and/or uncomfortable working environment which prevents an individual from effectively performing the duties of their position. It also encompasses such conduct when it is made a term or condition of employment or compensation, either implicitly or explicitly and when an employment decision is based on an individual\u2019s acceptance or rejection of such conduct.\n\nIt is important to note that sexual harassment crosses age and gender boundaries and cannot be stereotyped. Sexual harassment may exist on a continuum of behavior. For instance, one example of sexual harassment may be that of a Team Member showing offensive pictures to another Team Member. Generally, two categories of sexual harassment exist. The first, \"quid pro quo,\" may be defined as an exchange of sexual favors for improvement in your working conditions and/or compensation. The second category, \"hostile, intimidating, offensive working environment,\" can be described as a situation in which unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or another verbal or physical contact of a sexual nature when such conduct creates an intimidating or offensive environment. Examples of a hostile, intimidating, and offensive working environment include, but are not limited to, pictures, cartoons, symbols, or apparatus found to be offensive and which exist in the workspace of a Team Member. This behavior does not necessarily link improved working conditions in exchange for sexual favors. It is also against Capria\u2019s policy to download inappropriate pictures or materials from computer systems.\n\nResponsibility\n\nCapria Confidential\n22",
    "\\CV Employee & Consultant Handbook - August 2023_page_24.png": "All Team Members have a responsibility for keeping the work environment free of any and all forms of harassment. Any Team Member who becomes aware of an incident of harassment, whether by witnessing the incident or being told of it, must report it to their immediate manager, or a Managing Partner. When management becomes aware of the existence of harassment, prompt and appropriate action will be taken, whether or not the victim wants Capria to do so.\n\nActions and Reporting\nInstances of harassment should be promptly reported to Team Member's manager, or if the issue is with a manager, they should be reported to a Managing Partner, or to grievance@capria.vc which goes to the Managing Partners plus our experienced and trusted advisory board member, Pascal Vinarnic (who may be contacted directly via whatsapp at +44 7711 718276 or Pascal@Fondationdemeter.com). Finally, if you would like to speak to a female HR professional who is unaffiliated with Capria, you can ask a Managing Partner or Pascal for a contact.\n\nWhile Capria encourages you to communicate directly with the alleged harasser, and make it clear that the harasser's behavior is unacceptable, offensive, or inappropriate, it is not required that you do so. It is essential, however, to notify a Managing Partner immediately, even if you are not sure the offending behavior is considered harassment.\n\nAny Team Member found to have harassed a fellow Team Member would be subject to severe disciplinary action up to and including immediate termination. Capria will also take any additional action necessary to appropriately remedy the situation. Specific actions taken will be determined by the Managing Partners, using their best judgment, informed by expert advisors when needed, as to how to best maintain the positive and harassment-free environment described herein. Specific actions taken may or may not be communicated to parties involved in any specific situation.\n\nEducation and Awareness\nFrom time to time, Capria will re-remind Team Members of its position on avoidance of harassment, and may ask Team Members to read materials including those in this handbook, and/or take training classes to ensure understanding of the nuances of harassment.\n\nNo Retaliation, Individual Responsibility\nRetaliation of any sort will not be permitted. No adverse employment action will be taken for any Team Member making a good faith report of alleged harassment. Capria accepts no liability for harassment of one Team Member by another Team Member. The individual who makes unwelcome advances, threatens or in any way harasses another Team Member is personally liable for such actions and their consequences\n\nCapria Confidential\n23",

Capria will investigate any possible fraudulent or dishonest use or misuse of Capria resources or property by management, staff, or volunteers. Anyone found to have engaged in fraudulent or dishonest conduct is subject to disciplinary action by Capria up to and including civil or criminal prosecution when warranted.\n\nAll members of the Capria community are encouraged to report possible fraudulent or dishonest conduct (i.e., a whistleblower). Matters that should be reported under this policy include suspected fraud, theft, embezzlement, accounting and auditing irregularities, bribery, kickbacks, and misuse of Capria property. A Team Member should report their concerns to a manager. If for any reason a Team Member finds it difficult to report their concern to a manager, the Team Member can report it directly to a Managing Partner. Managers are required to report suspected fraudulent or dishonest conduct to a Managing Partner.\n\nNo Team Member who in good faith reports a violation under this Whistleblower Policy shall suffer harassment, retaliation or adverse consequences. A Team Member who retaliates against someone who has reported a violation in good faith is subject to discipline up to and including termination of employment or contractual agreements. Questions related to the interpretation of this policy should be directed to a Managing Partner.\n\nGrievance Mechanism\n\nIf you have a grievance, please send an email indicating your grievance to grievance@capria.vc which is sent to the Managing Partners and to our experienced and trusted advisory board member, Pascal Vinarnic (who may be contacted directly via whatsapp at +44 7711 718276 or Pascal@Fondationdemeter.com).\n\nCapria Confidential\n24",

And while we are a startup, we do recognize the importance of Team Members having the framework and support for building their individual skills and managing their careers. Please read Building Your Career at Capria.\n\nFrom time to time, Capria intends to review our compensation levels against available data from other relevant organizations. Please note that compensation information is deemed confidential between Capria and each Team Member, all of whom have specific circumstances of employment and compensation. Discussing compensation among Team Members is not permitted. Please read Capria Performance Review & Bonus Explainer for details on how we currently manage compensation.\n\nPay Periods\nTeam Members are paid once monthly, on the last day of the month, as a direct deposit into their bank account. To ensure Team Members receive their salary by the last day of the month, Capria targets to process payroll, when possible, by the 25th of every month. If the 25th day of the month happens to fall on a holiday or weekend, an effort will be made to process payroll on the previous banking day.\n\nFinal Pay\nTeam Members who leave Capria for any reason will receive all salary and other payments that are due to them at the time of their separation from Capria. Team Members will be paid for any unused PTO time provided that the Team Member has been diligent in maintaining records of their PTO and sick leave and the Team Member is considered a \u201cgood leaver\u201d as determined by their manager.\n\nManagement via 1-on-1s\nThere is too much to write on this topic, but there are two things we do a little differently at Capria that should be called out.

We want more junior members of the team to feel free to communicate with more senior members, and vice versa, about any topic. That said, people are busy and have priorities. So work with your manager to accomplish things before heading in the metaphorical door of a Managing Partner.\n\n2. **Regular 1-on-1s.** We believe it\u2019s vital for managers to have regular 1-on-1s with their Team Members. The 1-on-1s should have an agenda defined by the Team Member, which can be added to by the manager. This ensures that topics that matter to an individual contributor get airtime, and don\u2019t get pushed aside due to the demands of addressing day-to-day business concerns. We recommend a 1-hour 1-on-1 every 1-2 weeks, and at least once a month for more senior Team Members.\n\n---\n\n**Performance Management & Evaluation**\n\nCapria has a Performance Evaluation process designed to help each Team Member succeed and the organization to meet its goals.\n\n**Full-Time Team Members**\nSemi-annually, each Team Member will write a self-evaluation that assesses their accomplishments and performance. Twice a year, the manager and/or Team Member will also identify colleagues (superiors, peers, and subordinates) who are able to provide a confidential evaluation of the Team Member's performance and contribution to Capria based on their experience working with the Team Member during the year. Once all the evaluation forms (including self-evaluation) are completed and analyzed, each Team Member will receive a performance review from their manager, designed to provide candid and constructive performance feedback. Current practice is for shorter quarterly check-ins, with more in-depth check-ins after Q2 and Q4 that are tied to performance bonuses for eligible full-time Team Members. The principles explained in \u201cBuilding Your Career at Capria\u201d and \u201cManaging @ Capria\u201d are core to our management and people development philosophy.\n\nIn addition to the formal process, managers and Team Members are encouraged to discuss job performance and goals informally and regularly.\n\n**Interns & Fellows**\nInterns and fellows will not undergo formal evaluations but will hold a quarterly check-in with their supervisor. The quarterly check-in is an opportunity for the intern/fellow to self-reflect on their work and experience during the past quarter and compare against learning objectives and performance expectations set at the start of their internship or fellowship.\n\nCapria Confidential\n7",

A close relationship with your investee CxOs and fund GPs can be the competitive advantage that makes you or breaks you as a sought-after investor.\n      i. The relationship between Capria and the company CxO or GP has to be such that it\u2019s a story they want to highlight in a reference call about us: we add value in XX ways, we are a source for data insight, we provide intel on best practices, we advise on governance, we offer wise counsel on HR issues, etc.\n      ii. Without this relationship, information needs from the fund or company will become harder to get, and you will be just another source of cash, with a minority position that the CxO and GPs may or may not care to help you protect.\n   b. Striving to develop a relationship with the founders, board members, other investors, and the next-gen in the firm and/or fund is a MUST.\n      i. Proactive networking with peers and industry partners is also a must.\n      ii. Attending events or being part of the jury for pitch competitions is one way to see what's out there, and to be seen as Capria.\n      iii. Where possible, being a source of referrals for anything from talent hiring to service providers to business connections can also make a positive mark on your portfolio relationships.\n   c. Think about the following: if a potential business partner was checking you / Capria out via a portfolio CxO or GP over cocktails, how would those questions be answered?\n      i. \u201cDo you work with X at Capria? I\u2019m considering including them in my next round - what\u2019s your impression of him/her?\u201d\n      ii. \u201cWhat does he/she do for you that other investors do/don\u2019t do?\u201d\n      iii. \u201cWould you [partner with / hire] him/her if you had the opportunity?\u201d\n\n2. Keeping up with information on the sectors we invest in\n   a. Proactively learn about new companies, trends and markets\n   b. Understanding what the data tells you:\n      i. Up-to-date research on how each industry and market is growing and flexing is critical knowledge to maintain in order to make sound investment decisions pre-investment, follow-ons, or regarding a timely exit strategy.\n      ii. Do you spend 30 minutes every day reading about your regions and/or sectors and/or sub-sectors?\n      iii. Do you keep abreast of the dynamics of this fast-changing industry? Know where is the best data?\n      iv. Do you know who the biggest competitors are of the portfolio you manage, and are you abreast of their milestones in financing, growth etc?\n\n3. Using data for risk profiling\n   a. A clear understanding of how long it will take to gain a return on your investment is critical and goes hand in hand with market research when setting your portfolio management strategy.\n   b. Also helps you to think about exit timing. e.g. If there is going to be a big lag for a company to get to the next level, maybe we should look at exiting sooner.\n   c. Our methodology: we are asking fund managers to rate the companies in their portfolio on a scale from 1 to 4 (1- Return the Fund, 2- Top Performer, 3- Too Early to Tell).\n\nCapria Ventures LLC Confidential\n19",

F - don't do (too expensive or other issues).\n\nThis knowledge influences how we perceive the companies, with which company we decide to spend more time, and will also help us see who are the partner funds we can trust most in their \"good eye\" for investing.\n\ne. To be further analyzed: for funds, we can develop ratings that can be as simple as this one below:\n\n   i. Green: investment is performing according to expectations, or above.\n   ii. Yellow: investment begins to show signs of weaker than expected performance.\n   iii. Orange: investment is not doing well and a partial but considerable loss is expected.\n   iv.

This plan includes identifying exit targets and appropriate negotiation engagements in best and worst case scenarios for the business.\nd. You may not be directly involved with every company where you start a transaction; you may take over managing a deal that someone else started.

Secondary Sales Examples\n      - Cuemath (India, edtech): We were the pre-seed lead investor. Sold stakes to Sequoia and Google Capital in the Series A & B rounds at very low discounts\n      - MentalUp: We were the Series A co-investors with Idacapital and other investors. Sold stakes for a 1.65x return (net of the 15% upside taken by the fund manager)\n   b. Trade Sales Examples\n      - In April 2024 we completed an all-cash sale of India II portfolio company Awign for approximately USD 100M to Japanese HR services leader Mynavi. This resulted in approximately USD 22M being returned to LPs in four different Capria funds. Our India Fund II was the largest holder, having made the Seed investment on which it earned a 32x multiple on that first check (MOFC). Capria India Opportunity Fund had a position as did an SPV we had set up, and Capria Global South Fund I received a return due to its FoF position in India Fund II. This exit brought the DPI of India II to approximately .54 -- a strong return for a 2018 vintage fund.\n      - Pcredible (India, healthtech): Sold to a strategic buyer for 1.8x return.\n      - Welcare (India, healthtech): Sold to a strategic buyer for 2x return.\n   c. Founder Buyback Example\n      - UE LifeSciences (India, healthtech): Sold back our stake to the founder for 65% return of capital.\n   d. AcquiHire Example\n      - LabinApp: we facilitated the acqui-hire level sale of a struggling company in the EdTech space to the leading EdTech in India (Byjus). While we had only a minority profitable exit (1.2x MOIC), the company turned out to be enormously important to the acquiring edtech, buying us future \u201cpoints\u201d with the edtech leadership.\n\n2.
